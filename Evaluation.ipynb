        "#### ROUGE Scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE-1: 0.98 – The model has a very high recall of unigrams (individual words), meaning it's capturing a lot of the key words in the reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE-2: 0.98 – A high recall of bigrams (two-word sequences), suggesting the model is capturing key two-word combinations well.\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE-L: 0.98 – This is a recall-based metric that focuses on the longest matching subsequence of words, and this score suggests that the model is capturing the flow and structure of the sentences well.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Accuracy: 92.71%\n",
        "\n",
        "This indicates that nearly 93% of the predicted sentences exactly match the reference sentences, which is a strong performance in terms of exact matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### SacreBLEU Score: 96.94\n",

        "This score is extremely high and reinforces that the model's predictions are very close to the reference translations when considering standardized tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Conclusion:\n",
        "These evaluation results indicate that your model is performing exceptionally well in converting UK English to US English, both in terms of lexical accuracy (correct word choices) and structural accuracy (sentence flow). The SacreBLEU score in particular highlights that the translations are consistent and robust when using a standardized evaluation framework."
